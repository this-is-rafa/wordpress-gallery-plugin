Integrate iDangero.us Swiper with Minimart Wordpress theme.

== Description ==

This replaces the standard Wordpress gallery with a swipable gallery and thumbnails in responsive columns.

This is the start of a plugin created for a theme I made. It should work with any theme that uses bootstrap 3, but currently does not offer any options in terms of customization. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-minimart-swiper.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Note: if your theme does not use Bootstrap 3, you will need to link to those files yourself.

==To Do==

* Options for customizing the columns.

* Styling options such as borders.

* Toggles for including bootstrap in themese which don't use it.
